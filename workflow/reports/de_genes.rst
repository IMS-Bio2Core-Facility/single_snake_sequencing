Results of differential gene testing using a t-test with overestimated variance and a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction. Only the top 100 up-regulated genes are returned. The contents of each column are described below:

*Gene*: The gene symbol

*Z-score*: The number of standard deviations above or below mean

*Adj. p_val*: The multiple-test corrected probability the gene is differentially expressed

*log2 FC*: The median log2 fold change

*Enrichment*: The percent of cells in cluster expressing divide by the percent of cells out of cluster expressing.
